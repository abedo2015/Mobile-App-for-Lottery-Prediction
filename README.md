# Mobile-App-for-Lottery-Prediction
What are the chances of winning the lottery?

In this project, we will try to contribute to the development of a mobile app aimed at helping individuals understand their chances of actually winning a lottery. The app idea originates from a medical institute that specializes in treating gambling addictions.

While the institute already has a team in place for developing the app, we have been tasked with developing the core logic to determine the proper probabilities of winning. For the first version of the app, we want to focus on the 6/49 lottery and answer the following questions:

* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket?
